# Klaudia Radej - Software Tester

## About me

Hi! My name is Klaudia and I am an ISTQB Certified Software Tester. I am pretty new to Testing, but it gives me a fresh perspective on a lot of things. 
 
Why IT? My husband is a software developer with 8 years of experience and I know few testers who are satisfied with their work. Testing might be the best profession for me. Why? More on this later. 
 
Why now? I am a young mom and I need changes in my life. My previous job didn't give me enough satisfaction - I felt a little bit burned out. 
 
I am very positive and ambitious person. I need a profession that allow me constantly self-develop. 
I love team work but also really appreciate working alone. I am a team player and I know how to speak with others.
I am also really curious and inquisitive. Looking for a faults is my natural trait. Looking for a way to break something down sounds like fun for me.
In the future I want to be automation tester. I already have a few projects in my portfolio and I'm still developing my skills in this area.
